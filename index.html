            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi. My name is Christopher Meza. I am majoring in Web Design
                & Development at Brigham Young University - Idaho. By doing
                so, I have acquired many skills that have helped me to become
                experienced in this field. I have also become involved in several
                extracurricular groups which include martial arts, social activities
                and events, and sports teams. Additionally, I have had the opportunity
                to hold leadership positions in these clubs. As I will be graduating
                in the coming year, I am looking for an internship where I can further
                develop and utilize the skills which I have acquired.

            development and visual design. However, I have also learned and

                    As the title mentions, I carried out a project in which I photographed individuals for
                    18 days straight. The purpose of this project was to develop the habit of not only
                    photographing individuals but also communicating with the client. Once I was I was done
                    taking and editing the photographs I would create a profile mockup of each individual.
                    This mockup would be the end product which would be delivered to the client along with
                    the photograph which was used for it.

                    Deadly Island is a board game idea which I, along with a few other individuals,

                    the game, and sought to improve and market it. As I have experience in web
                    development and design I created a wireframe, a mockup, and a website for this
                    board game.
